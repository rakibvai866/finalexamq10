    <h3>What is the CSS box model, and how does it work?</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that defines the layout and sizing of elements on 
        a web page. It describes how each HTML element is represented as a rectangular box with content, 
        padding, border, and margin.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Content: The actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements, is contained within the content box.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Padding: The padding is a transparent area surrounding the content box. It provides space between the content and the border. You can set the padding using the padding property.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Border: The border is a line that goes around the padding and content. It separates the element from its neighboring elements. You can set the border using the border property.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Margin: The margin is a transparent area surrounding the border. It provides space between the element and other elements on the page. You can set the margin using the margin property.
    </p>
    <p>
        The total width of an element is calculated as the sum of the content width, padding, and border. 
        The total height is calculated as the sum of the content height, padding, and border. The margin 
        does not affect the total size of the element but influences the spacing between elements.

        In this example, the total width of the .box element would be 244 pixels (200px width + 2 * 10px 
        padding + 2 * 2px border), and the total height would be 124 pixels (100px height + 2 * 10px padding 
        + 2 * 2px border). The element would also have a margin of 20 pixels on all sides, creating space 
        between neighboring elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding the CSS box model is essential for precise layout and positioning of elements on a web 
        page. It allows developers to control how much space each element occupies and how elements interact 
        with each other in the layout.
